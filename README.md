<p>The following system is a system with two degrees of freedom. A mass frame mounted on a link length l1 ended with a joint with resistance c, the mass m was taken as the mass concentrated at the end of a rigid link length l2. The system is described by two angles: α and Ψ. A schematic layout is shown in the figure below:</p>
